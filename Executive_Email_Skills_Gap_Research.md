**Subject:** European Skills Gap Research Complete - 8 New Bootcamp Opportunities Identified

Team,

Our European skills gap analysis is ready for review. Here's what the research shows:

**The Opportunity**
- 7.8M ICT specialist shortfall projected in Europe by 2030
- 57% of EU firms currently unable to find qualified tech staff
- 59% of workers globally will need reskilling by 2030 (WEF)
- Our markets show high skill disruption rates: Portugal 44%, Spain 37%, Germany 34%

**Key Findings**

We identified **8 viable new bootcamp concepts** with minimal portfolio overlap:

| Concept | Why Now |
|---------|---------|
| Cloud & AI Security Engineering | Zero European bootcamps combining both |
| Computer Vision Engineering | Only 1 competitor (Datascientest) |
| Green Tech & AI for Sustainability | Complete white space in Europe |
| SAP S/4HANA Platform | 2027 migration deadline, 61% haven't migrated |
| Mobile Development with AI | Portfolio gap, competitor presence validates demand |
| FinTech Engineering | WEF #2 fastest-growing role |
| IoT Development & Edge Computing | WEF #10 fastest-growing role |
| AI-Powered Java Development | Addresses #1 skills shortage (64% gap) |

We're also recommending **2 enhancements** to existing bootcamps rather than new launches: LLM rebranding for AI Engineering and expanded MLOps in Data Science.

**What We Ruled Out**
- MLOps, LLM Engineering, AI Security as standalone (too much overlap)
- Blockchain, Game Dev, Quantum (market volatility, hardware constraints, too early)
- IT Support, Digital Sales (shrinking job markets per WEF)

Full report attached.

**Next Steps**
- Evaluate junior job opportunities in EU for each bootcamp candidate
- Analyze search volume data for each candidate to gauge student demand

Let's schedule time to discuss prioritization.
