### Source 13: PwC AI Jobs Barometer 2025

**Publication Date:** 2025
**Methodology:** Global AI job market analysis, productivity studies, skills-based hiring research

**Key Findings:**

**Shift to Skills-Based Hiring:**
- **AI-augmented jobs requiring degrees fell from 66% (2019) to 59% (2024)**
- Indicates move toward skills-based hiring over credential requirements
- Opens pathways for non-traditional candidates including bootcamp graduates

**Productivity Impact:**
- Industries most exposed to AI: **nearly 4x higher productivity growth** than least exposed industries
- AI adoption correlates strongly with economic performance
- Pressure on companies to adopt AI and train workers intensifies

**Implications for Skills Gaps:**
PwC's data on degree requirement reduction (66% to 59%) is critical for bootcamp positioning—employers increasingly value demonstrated AI skills over traditional credentials. The 4x productivity differential between AI-adopting and non-adopting industries creates urgency: companies must train existing workers or recruit AI-capable talent to remain competitive. This skills-over-credentials trend strongly favors intensive bootcamp models over 4-year degrees.

### Source 15: Entry-Level/Junior Developer Market Crisis 2024-2025

**Publication Date:** 2024-2025
**Methodology:** EURES labor platform data, LinkedIn job posting analysis, Indeed.com statistics, Stanford Digital Economy Study, Handshake internship platform data

**Key Findings:**

**Dramatic Decline in Junior Positions:**
- **35% decline in entry-level tech positions** across major EU economies (2024)
- Job platforms: EURES, LinkedIn, Indeed all report consistent declines
- Netherlands: **~40% drop in entry-level developer roles**
- Germany: Mittelstand companies increasingly opt for automation/outsourcing over junior hires
- Amsterdam, Munich, Copenhagen: Shrinking listings for junior software developers, QA testers, support engineers, data analysts

**The Entry-Level Experience Paradox:**
- "Entry-level" jobs now require **3-5 years of experience**
- Advanced digital competencies expected for "entry" positions
- ATS and AI-driven recruitment systems filter out applicants without prior experience
- Many applicants never seen by human reviewers

**AI Impact on Junior Roles:**
- Stanford Digital Economy Study: **20% decline in employment for software developers aged 22-25** from peak (late 2022) to July 2025
- Handshake (internship platform): **30% decline in tech-specific internship postings** since 2023
- Junior/entry work increasingly automated or eliminated

**Current Job Availability:**
- TotalJobs: 337 Junior Developer jobs in Europe (limited inventory)
- Indeed.com: 171 Europe Junior Developer positions
- Significantly reduced from pre-2023 levels

**Opportunities Within Crisis:**
- Shift opens doors for **career changers and self-taught developers**
- **Skill-first hiring trend** benefits bootcamp graduates with project portfolios
- **Demand for specialized roles (AI engineers, cloud experts, cybersecurity) far outstrips supply**
- Some regional resilience: Portugal tech growth, Spain hospitality-tech crossover

**Implications for Skills Gaps:**
The junior developer crisis creates paradox: massive ICT specialist shortage (9.7 million gap) coexists with 35% decline in entry-level positions. This indicates employers seek "ready-to-contribute" talent, not "train-on-the-job" juniors. Bootcamp programs must therefore deliver job-ready graduates with portfolios demonstrating 1-2 years equivalent experience. The crisis also reveals opportunity: specialized areas (AI, cloud, cybersecurity) maintain strong junior hiring where generalist "junior developer" roles decline.

**Risk Factors:**
- **Low-code/no-code:** Vendor dependency (Salesforce, Microsoft) - curriculum tied to platform evolution
- **QA automation:** AI might eventually automate testing itself - hedge by emphasizing strategic test design over script-writing
- **Green tech:** Requires domain expertise Ironhack may not have in-house - consider partnerships with environmental organizations

**Validation Steps Before Launch:**
1. **Employer demand validation:** Interview 20-30 hiring managers in target markets about low-code, QA, green tech hiring needs
2. **Learner demand validation:** Survey existing Ironhack students and alumni about interest in these verticals
3. **Pilot program:** Run 1-2 cohorts at small scale (15-20 students) before full launch
4. **Partnership development:** Establish relationships with Salesforce, Microsoft, environmental NGOs for curriculum support and hiring pipeline
